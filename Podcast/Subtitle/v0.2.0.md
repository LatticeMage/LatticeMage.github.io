1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:05
 Okay, honestly, the last podcast was a bit too long.

2
0:00:05 --> 0:00:07
 That creates a few problems.

3
0:00:07 --> 0:00:10
 The first is on the English translation side,

4
0:00:10 --> 0:00:13
 that it takes longer to say everything.

5
0:00:13 --> 0:00:17
 I think the key problem is that the Japanese part,

6
0:00:17 --> 0:00:21
 because I also will translate this into Japanese to practice Japanese.

7
0:00:22 --> 0:00:25
 If I record too long on the Chinese part,

8
0:00:25 --> 0:00:28
 for English part, it's not a big problem.

9
0:00:28 --> 0:00:32
 But for Japanese part, that is hard for me to record

10
0:00:32 --> 0:00:35
 and find the sentence that I want to speak.

11
0:00:36 --> 0:00:36
 Yeah.

12
0:00:37 --> 0:00:39
 Okay, let's about today's topic.

13
0:00:40 --> 0:00:43
 I think the topic for today will be, for example,

14
0:00:44 --> 0:00:47
 Unity, Ubisoft, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine,

15
0:00:47 --> 0:00:51
 that we can start from talking about the C Sharp language.

16
0:00:52 --> 0:00:55
 Okay, for example, for the Unity engine,

17
0:00:56 --> 0:00:58
 its core is C++.

18
0:00:58 --> 0:01:02
 And it have a C Sharp interface for developer.

19
0:01:02 --> 0:01:06
 Because C++, it's higher performance,

20
0:01:06 --> 0:01:09
 and C Sharp, it's more friendly for user.

21
0:01:10 --> 0:01:13
 And also, such as the Godot engine,

22
0:01:13 --> 0:01:16
 it use the C++ as its core.

23
0:01:16 --> 0:01:22
 However, it script, it's a GD script for user developing interface.

24
0:01:22 --> 0:01:25
 And also, because the core is C++,

25
0:01:25 --> 0:01:28
 and the port can be concat to other,

26
0:01:28 --> 0:01:30
 it's a C++ language.

27
0:01:30 --> 0:01:33
 So Godot also have a C Sharp interface.

28
0:01:33 --> 0:01:38
 But the first official language natively, it's GD script.

29
0:01:38 --> 0:01:42
 And the C Sharp, it's more like the secondary official language.

30
0:01:42 --> 0:01:47
 And although that the developer claim that they will make C Sharp,

31
0:01:47 --> 0:01:53
 it's like the primary language, but it's still secondary until now.

32
0:01:54 --> 0:01:57
 And also, as I mentioned earlier,

33
0:01:57 --> 0:01:58
 that the C++ language, it's not the primary language.

34
0:01:58 --> 0:02:03
 It's the C++ port can concat to connect to other language.

35
0:02:03 --> 0:02:05
 For example, Rust.

36
0:02:05 --> 0:02:10
 It's also, there's an engine called Godot Rust

37
0:02:10 --> 0:02:16
 that user can use Rust to create a game with the Godot engine.

38
0:02:16 --> 0:02:17
 So it's Godot Rust.

39
0:02:17 --> 0:02:23
 And also, the sound features is even more better than Bevy.

40
0:02:23 --> 0:02:27
 So if people who want to use the Rust, Godot Rust,

41
0:02:27 --> 0:02:27
 it's possible.

42
0:02:28 --> 0:02:30
 So it's a very good solution.

43
0:02:30 --> 0:02:30
 Yeah.

44
0:02:30 --> 0:02:32
 And we look back to Unreal Engine.

45
0:02:32 --> 0:02:36
 Of course, Unreal Engine, the core is C++.

46
0:02:36 --> 0:02:42
 However, it's gradually try to support with the C Sharp.

47
0:02:42 --> 0:02:47
 And also, the AAA game developed by Chinese team,

48
0:02:47 --> 0:02:52
 the Hei Shenhua Wukong, that Wukong that is also the team

49
0:02:52 --> 0:02:58
 that it build mainly on C Sharp tools based on the Unreal Engine.

50
0:02:58 --> 0:03:04
 And the developers can use C Sharp to coding on the Unreal Engine.

51
0:03:04 --> 0:03:09
 They will have several advantages.

52
0:03:09 --> 0:03:14
 Because there are a lot of developer C Sharp Unity,

53
0:03:14 --> 0:03:18
 because the C Sharp, most users are from the Unity.

54
0:03:18 --> 0:03:23
 So they can absorb from the developer of the Unity.

55
0:03:23 --> 0:03:28
 And the second, that it can speed up the developing time.

56
0:03:28 --> 0:03:32
 Because C++ developing, it's really hard.

57
0:03:32 --> 0:03:36
 And we now mention Unreal Engine.

58
0:03:36 --> 0:03:40
 So how about that we watch two more teams.

59
0:03:40 --> 0:03:50
 For example, Witcher 3, the CDPR team, that it's the 2077 team,

60
0:03:50 --> 0:03:56
 that 2077, that also their new game try to switch to Unreal Engine.

61
0:03:56 --> 0:03:57
 Because self-produced.

62
0:03:57 --> 0:04:00
 And they have a lot of development engine.

63
0:04:00 --> 0:04:03
 It's not worth anymore.

64
0:04:03 --> 0:04:07
 And also, for the Sony, the Sony company,

65
0:04:07 --> 0:04:11
 they have many studios inside the Sony Entertainment.

66
0:04:11 --> 0:04:16
 And they try to lay off many studios that not using Unreal Engine.

67
0:04:16 --> 0:04:26
 So by this way, Sony is making Unreal Engine up to their strategic engine.

68
0:04:27 --> 0:04:29
 And the reason why they are doing Unreal Engine,

69
0:04:29 --> 0:04:31
 because they want to make Unreal Engine,

70
0:04:31 --> 0:04:32
 is because they want to make Unreal Engine,

71
0:04:32 --> 0:04:35
 and they want to make Unreal Engine more accessible to the entire company.

72
0:04:35 --> 0:04:36
 This will have many benefits.

73
0:04:36 --> 0:04:41
 First, that they can hire more people who will easily to hire people

74
0:04:41 --> 0:04:43
 who familiar with game engine.

75
0:04:43 --> 0:04:47
 They don't need people to relearn other engine game.

76
0:04:47 --> 0:04:52
 And second is that because Sony have many studios.

77
0:04:52 --> 0:04:56
 And if entire company all use Unreal Engine,

78
0:04:56 --> 0:04:57
 they can make different studio to support each other.

79
0:04:57 --> 0:05:01
 And also, the third reason is that,

80
0:05:01 --> 0:05:03
 it's maybe it's the major reason,

81
0:05:03 --> 0:05:07
 is that Sony had itself multimedia industry.

82
0:05:07 --> 0:05:10
 So in this case, that because the ray tracing,

83
0:05:10 --> 0:05:13
 the real-time ray tracing in Unreal is very beautiful.

84
0:05:13 --> 0:05:17
 So they can use this to help such as movie creating,

85
0:05:17 --> 0:05:20
 that for the environment building,

86
0:05:20 --> 0:05:24
 and for the scene, and even such as some modeling.

87
0:05:24 --> 0:05:27
 Yeah, it's very helpful for their entertainment,

88
0:05:27 --> 0:05:32
 and entire Sony empire.

89
0:05:32 --> 0:05:33
 Yeah.

90
0:05:33 --> 0:05:39
 And next, we're going to talk about that such as the Capcom.

91
0:05:39 --> 0:05:43
 The Capcom has its self-made RE engine.

92
0:05:43 --> 0:05:47
 The RE engine core, it's C++.

93
0:05:47 --> 0:05:51
 And also, the RE engine, the interface is C sharp also.

94
0:05:51 --> 0:05:57
 So developer at Capcom is still using the C sharp.

95
0:05:57 --> 0:05:57
 So that's it.

96
0:05:57 --> 0:06:00
 It's possible that you're learning C sharp.

97
0:06:00 --> 0:06:05
 It's very worthy that because you can working at different company,

98
0:06:05 --> 0:06:08
 and many engines trying to support more and more.

99
0:06:08 --> 0:06:11
 Yeah, that's a good possible.

100
0:06:11 --> 0:06:12
 Yeah.

101
0:06:12 --> 0:06:17
 And we are going to talking about that such as Ubisoft.

102
0:06:17 --> 0:06:22
 OK, Ubisoft, that was, we will call that Ken games,

103
0:06:22 --> 0:06:26
 because they are AAA games are most fast food like.

104
0:06:26 --> 0:06:27
 For example,

105
0:06:27 --> 0:06:29
 they will have a complex scene,

106
0:06:29 --> 0:06:32
 but the task or the missions,

107
0:06:32 --> 0:06:35
 and such as the map,

108
0:06:35 --> 0:06:41
 they will have many duplicate things that are all generated by their inner tools.

109
0:06:41 --> 0:06:47
 So in the early years that the Unity have their very good auto generation,

110
0:06:47 --> 0:06:54
 their system that they can generate such as the Terra terrain,

111
0:06:54 --> 0:06:57
 and also the buildings and the missions,

112
0:06:57 --> 0:07:02
 and it's very good for generating a large game.

113
0:07:02 --> 0:07:03
 But however,

114
0:07:03 --> 0:07:06
 at the current era, AIGC era,

115
0:07:06 --> 0:07:10
 that even a small team can use AI to generate many models.

116
0:07:10 --> 0:07:11
 For example,

117
0:07:11 --> 0:07:15
 Blender also have merged AI tools.

118
0:07:15 --> 0:07:18
 So this is a bad news for Unity,

119
0:07:18 --> 0:07:22
 because they are hard to compete with the small team.

120
0:07:22 --> 0:07:25
 And also they have a very high developing cost.

121
0:07:25 --> 0:07:25
 And moreover, that, you know,

122
0:07:25 --> 0:07:26
 And moreover, that, you know,

123
0:07:26 --> 0:07:27
 And moreover, that, you know,

124
0:07:27 --> 0:07:27
 And moreover, that, you know,

125
0:07:27 --> 0:07:29
 that for the older,

126
0:07:29 --> 0:07:32
 for the last to generate players,

127
0:07:32 --> 0:07:37
 we want to see that Ubisoft have new possible,

128
0:07:37 --> 0:07:41
 because in the past Ubisoft was a really good company.

129
0:07:41 --> 0:07:43
 They have many good IP,

130
0:07:43 --> 0:07:44
 for example,

131
0:07:44 --> 0:07:46
 HOMM Heroes of My Magic,

132
0:07:46 --> 0:07:48
 that kind of this IP,

133
0:07:48 --> 0:07:51
 but they are not using this IP well.

134
0:07:51 --> 0:07:53
 In the recent years,

135
0:07:53 --> 0:07:56
 they just want to do some DEI strategy,

136
0:07:56 --> 0:07:56
 They just want to do some DEI strategy,

137
0:07:57 --> 0:07:58
 and yeah,

138
0:07:58 --> 0:08:02
 the company is more against the community.

139
0:08:02 --> 0:08:07
 Yeah, that's very, very, very displeased.

140
0:08:07 --> 0:08:08
 Yeah.

141
0:08:08 --> 0:08:09
 Okay.

142
0:08:09 --> 0:08:14
 So let's talk about the marketing.

143
0:08:14 --> 0:08:19
 That as we know that in the last generation,

144
0:08:19 --> 0:08:23
 people will watch such as the TV and listening with the CD.

145
0:08:23 --> 0:08:27
 So usually we will, it's, you know,

146
0:08:27 --> 0:08:28
 it's a last generation,

147
0:08:28 --> 0:08:32
 they will have a common understanding of the entertainment.

148
0:08:32 --> 0:08:33
 For example,

149
0:08:33 --> 0:08:38
 they all know who is Michael Jackson and such as the author,

150
0:08:38 --> 0:08:39
 they will watch the TV.

151
0:08:39 --> 0:08:41
 So they will see the same author.

152
0:08:41 --> 0:08:44
 You can not have so much solution,

153
0:08:44 --> 0:08:47
 so much options to see others.

154
0:08:47 --> 0:08:50
 So you always see the same movies,

155
0:08:50 --> 0:08:52
 but for now,

156
0:08:52 --> 0:08:56
 such as you will use the T-talk or you may use Facebook,

157
0:08:56 --> 0:08:57
 Facebook threads,

158
0:08:57 --> 0:08:59
 and even YouTube,

159
0:08:59 --> 0:09:02
 a lot of entertainment in playing game.

160
0:09:02 --> 0:09:05
 You may play mobile games in console games.

161
0:09:05 --> 0:09:08
 There are too many options for entertainment.

162
0:09:08 --> 0:09:10
 So that will trigger a problem.

163
0:09:10 --> 0:09:12
 It's not probably a phenomenon.

164
0:09:12 --> 0:09:20
 The phenomenon is that the era of now is highly segmentation and fragmentation.

165
0:09:20 --> 0:09:25
 So people will stick to their small group and they will have their inner joy,

166
0:09:25 --> 0:09:26
 and they will have their inner joy,

167
0:09:26 --> 0:09:29
 and they will have their mimis.

168
0:09:29 --> 0:09:32
 And it's hard to understand by the outside people.

169
0:09:32 --> 0:09:34
 So because the group,

170
0:09:34 --> 0:09:37
 it's a very segment and fragment.

171
0:09:37 --> 0:09:38
 So people,

172
0:09:38 --> 0:09:40
 it's hard to,

173
0:09:40 --> 0:09:41
 it's impossible to,

174
0:09:41 --> 0:09:45
 there's an alter or something that is known by everyone.

175
0:09:45 --> 0:09:50
 And this is a disaster for the AAA studio,

176
0:09:50 --> 0:09:55
 because they need highly cost to create a large game and want to sell,

177
0:09:55 --> 0:09:59
 all the world to have,

178
0:09:59 --> 0:10:00
 to earn the money.

179
0:10:00 --> 0:10:06
 But the problem is that once the society is more segment and fragment,

180
0:10:06 --> 0:10:12
 that people will not prefer AAA anymore.

181
0:10:12 --> 0:10:14
 So that's for there,

182
0:10:14 --> 0:10:17
 that's hard to make a bigger market.

183
0:10:17 --> 0:10:19
 The marketing even will shrink.

184
0:10:19 --> 0:10:21
 So, and also,

185
0:10:21 --> 0:10:24
 as we say that for the AIGC tools,

186
0:10:24 --> 0:10:25
 for the small studio,

187
0:10:25 --> 0:10:27
 then for the indie games,

188
0:10:27 --> 0:10:31
 indie games will get benefit from the modern era,

189
0:10:31 --> 0:10:32
 because modern era,

190
0:10:32 --> 0:10:34
 it's segmentation.

191
0:10:34 --> 0:10:36
 So the indie games,

192
0:10:36 --> 0:10:39
 they don't need to have highly sales.

193
0:10:39 --> 0:10:44
 They just need to small sales and they need to have a true fan,

194
0:10:44 --> 0:10:46
 that they have an iron fan.

195
0:10:46 --> 0:10:50
 They can just earn enough for their living fee.

196
0:10:50 --> 0:10:51
 Yeah.

197
0:10:51 --> 0:10:52
 So yeah,

198
0:10:52 --> 0:10:54
 that's a big problem for them.

199
0:10:54 --> 0:10:55
 Also,

200
0:10:55 --> 0:10:56
 yeah,

201
0:10:56 --> 0:10:58
 I think that's talk much.

202
0:10:58 --> 0:11:00
 And as we said before that,

203
0:11:00 --> 0:11:03
 I want to record too long because it's not,

204
0:11:03 --> 0:11:07
 not good for other Japanese language.

205
0:11:07 --> 0:11:08
 So just today,

206
0:11:08 --> 0:11:09
 well, that's it.

207
0:11:09 --> 0:11:11
 Thank you and bye.
