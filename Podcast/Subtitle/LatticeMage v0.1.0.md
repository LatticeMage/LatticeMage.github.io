0:00:00 --> 0:00:04
 Hi everyone, this is LatticeMage.

2
0:00:04 --> 0:00:07
 Alright, so this is the start of a new series.

3
0:00:07 --> 0:00:09
 And why this is a new series?

4
0:00:09 --> 0:00:11
 Mainly, it's great to...

5
0:00:11 --> 0:00:14
 I rebrand myself that...

6
0:00:14 --> 0:00:18
 rebrand that into the four different brands.

7
0:00:18 --> 0:00:21
 And then, this is a new concept about that

8
0:00:21 --> 0:00:26
 I will record the video in the original, my Chinese version,

9
0:00:26 --> 0:00:29
 and convert into the English part that...

10
0:00:29 --> 0:00:32
 For example, I use the AI.

11
0:00:32 --> 0:00:35
 Currently, the GPT, it's very sucks.

12
0:00:35 --> 0:00:39
 And now the AI such as cloud,

13
0:00:39 --> 0:00:43
 actually, it will stop during just process half.

14
0:00:43 --> 0:00:47
 So, it's only if the Google German line can come...

15
0:00:47 --> 0:00:53
 can convert my entire Chinese podcast into the English podcast part.

16
0:00:53 --> 0:00:57
 And then, the key is that the new brand...

17
0:00:57 --> 0:00:58
 the new branding also...

18
0:00:58 --> 0:00:59
 I speak...

19
0:00:59 --> 0:01:02
 can convert my entire Chinese podcast into 4 brands.

20
0:01:02 --> 0:01:04
 That is, AlchemyMage,

21
0:01:04 --> 0:01:06
 second, it's the LatticeMage,

22
0:01:06 --> 0:01:10
 and third, it's the Xinla, it's the ShenluoMage.

23
0:01:10 --> 0:01:13
 And the fourth is the Homage, that means Homunculus.

24
0:01:13 --> 0:01:17
 So, for the AlchemyMage part, it will use the Chinese version.

25
0:01:17 --> 0:01:21
 For the LatticeMage part, it will use the English version.

26
0:01:21 --> 0:01:24
 And for the XinglaMage, ShenluoMage part,

27
0:01:24 --> 0:01:26
 will use the Japanese version.

28
0:01:26 --> 0:01:28
 And Homunculus,

29
0:01:28 --> 0:01:30
 on AI topic, and they will have

30
0:01:30 --> 0:01:32
 a podcast there. So I'll

31
0:01:32 --> 0:01:34
 record in original Chinese

32
0:01:34 --> 0:01:36
 and convert into English and Japanese version

33
0:01:36 --> 0:01:37
 for the podcast.

34
0:01:38 --> 0:01:40
 And then, next topic

35
0:01:40 --> 0:01:42
 is about the versioning, that

36
0:01:42 --> 0:01:44
 we start from 0

37
0:01:44 --> 0:01:46
 again, so this I will call

38
0:01:46 --> 0:01:48
 Serious 0. And

39
0:01:48 --> 0:01:49
 the funny part is that

40
0:01:49 --> 0:01:52
 my podcast title will become

41
0:01:52 --> 0:01:54
 like the semantic version.

42
0:01:54 --> 0:01:56
 For example, it will

43
0:01:56 --> 0:01:58
 be V 0.1

44
0:01:58 --> 0:02:00
 or 1.2.

45
0:02:00 --> 0:02:02
 That means it's the same as the

46
0:02:02 --> 0:02:04
 version concept, and it will

47
0:02:04 --> 0:02:06
 use the semantic version. That means

48
0:02:06 --> 0:02:07
 we will have a major version

49
0:02:07 --> 0:02:09
 and the minor version.

50
0:02:10 --> 0:02:11
 So the major means

51
0:02:11 --> 0:02:14
 we will have a huge change.

52
0:02:14 --> 0:02:16
 For the minor, that

53
0:02:16 --> 0:02:17
 it will be a little change.

54
0:02:18 --> 0:02:20
 But in the podcast, in this

55
0:02:20 --> 0:02:22
 series, the major means

56
0:02:22 --> 0:02:24
 the season. And

57
0:02:24 --> 0:02:26
 for the minor part, it will mean

58
0:02:26 --> 0:02:28
 the, for example, it's

59
0:02:28 --> 0:02:30
 the episode. And they will have

60
0:02:30 --> 0:02:32
 the final number, 0.0.

61
0:02:32 --> 0:02:33
 It's useless because

62
0:02:33 --> 0:02:36
 we don't have any patch

63
0:02:36 --> 0:02:36
 about that.

64
0:02:38 --> 0:02:40
 And then, the next topic

65
0:02:40 --> 0:02:42
 is about that, why we have

66
0:02:42 --> 0:02:44
 this new series, is that

67
0:02:44 --> 0:02:46
 for the Atomic Habit,

68
0:02:46 --> 0:02:48
 it's kind of

69
0:02:48 --> 0:02:50
 the book. It's talking about that

70
0:02:50 --> 0:02:51
 how we build up

71
0:02:51 --> 0:02:54
 our habit

72
0:02:54 --> 0:02:55
 from the long term.

73
0:02:56 --> 0:02:57
 And the key is that

74
0:02:57 --> 0:03:00
 we cannot just shift

75
0:03:00 --> 0:03:01
 into

76
0:03:01 --> 0:03:02
 different

77
0:03:02 --> 0:03:06
 from our life. The Atomic

78
0:03:06 --> 0:03:08
 Habit, an easy or proven

79
0:03:08 --> 0:03:09
 way to build good habits

80
0:03:09 --> 0:03:11
 and break bad ones.

81
0:03:12 --> 0:03:14
 This book is emphasized that

82
0:03:14 --> 0:03:15
 when every

83
0:03:15 --> 0:03:18
 small habit you want to build,

84
0:03:18 --> 0:03:20
 we need to start from

85
0:03:20 --> 0:03:21
 a very small one.

86
0:03:21 --> 0:03:24
 For example, if you have already

87
0:03:24 --> 0:03:25
 been doing something every day, then we

88
0:03:25 --> 0:03:27
 build small things on that.

89
0:03:27 --> 0:03:30
 That will be more easy to keep

90
0:03:30 --> 0:03:31
 going to do.

91
0:03:32 --> 0:03:34
 For example, for me,

92
0:03:34 --> 0:03:36
 I want to force myself

93
0:03:36 --> 0:03:38
 to go to gym and practice

94
0:03:38 --> 0:03:40
 strength training

95
0:03:40 --> 0:03:41
 or weight training.

96
0:03:42 --> 0:03:44
 But the problem is that if I want to

97
0:03:44 --> 0:03:45
 build this habit,

98
0:03:46 --> 0:03:47
 it's very dramatically

99
0:03:47 --> 0:03:49
 from my original static

100
0:03:49 --> 0:03:51
 life, it's very hard.

101
0:03:51 --> 0:03:54
 So, the better way is that, for example,

102
0:03:54 --> 0:03:55
 I try to first week,

103
0:03:55 --> 0:03:57
 I just wear the shoes

104
0:03:57 --> 0:04:00
 and when I

105
0:04:00 --> 0:04:01
 wear on my shoes

106
0:04:01 --> 0:04:03
 and go out the door and back,

107
0:04:03 --> 0:04:05
 this will be my second,

108
0:04:06 --> 0:04:07
 maybe the first week.

109
0:04:07 --> 0:04:09
 And the second week, maybe it's walking

110
0:04:09 --> 0:04:11
 to the gym and go back to home.

111
0:04:11 --> 0:04:14
 This will be the second week.

112
0:04:14 --> 0:04:15
 That means for every

113
0:04:15 --> 0:04:17
 week, we just do

114
0:04:17 --> 0:04:19
 a very small change.

115
0:04:19 --> 0:04:21
 This is almost zero cost.

116
0:04:22 --> 0:04:22
 Yeah.

117
0:04:24 --> 0:04:25
 And next topic,

118
0:04:25 --> 0:04:25
 it's

119
0:04:25 --> 0:04:27
 about that it's hard to

120
0:04:27 --> 0:04:29
 choose the podcast

121
0:04:30 --> 0:04:31
 topics for every week, right?

122
0:04:32 --> 0:04:34
 For example, it's very hard

123
0:04:34 --> 0:04:36
 to speak the same topic

124
0:04:37 --> 0:04:39
 if we're hearing some podcast

125
0:04:40 --> 0:04:41
 or YouTube channel.

126
0:04:41 --> 0:04:43
 It's very hard to find many

127
0:04:43 --> 0:04:45
 topics for every week.

128
0:04:46 --> 0:04:47
 But for me, maybe it's

129
0:04:47 --> 0:04:50
 well, not for harder because

130
0:04:50 --> 0:04:52
 I have enough knowledge base.

131
0:04:53 --> 0:04:54
 You can know that we have

132
0:04:54 --> 0:04:55
 the four bread.

133
0:04:55 --> 0:04:55
 I'm making a video about it.

134
0:04:55 --> 0:04:58
 So that means I can take

135
0:04:58 --> 0:05:00
 one topic and use different

136
0:05:01 --> 0:05:03
 perspective from a different domain

137
0:05:03 --> 0:05:05
 or such as maybe get this

138
0:05:05 --> 0:05:08
 sign or maybe physics or science,

139
0:05:08 --> 0:05:11
 or maybe we will use some art

140
0:05:11 --> 0:05:14
 concept or competitive psychology

141
0:05:14 --> 0:05:17
 or anything that your parents that

142
0:05:17 --> 0:05:18
 to talking about this topic.

143
0:05:18 --> 0:05:21
 So for me, I will more prefer

144
0:05:21 --> 0:05:25
 that I will choose the maybe this week.

145
0:05:25 --> 0:05:29
 I watch some video or listening

146
0:05:29 --> 0:05:31
 some podcast and choose a topic

147
0:05:31 --> 0:05:34
 from that and even maybe

148
0:05:34 --> 0:05:35
 some reading books.

149
0:05:35 --> 0:05:35
 Okay.

150
0:05:36 --> 0:05:38
 So I think that's a strength for me

151
0:05:38 --> 0:05:42
 that actually my reading, it's not

152
0:05:42 --> 0:05:45
 a very large, but it's the amount

153
0:05:46 --> 0:05:51
 it's more than general people.

154
0:05:51 --> 0:05:53
 For example, maybe I will read

155
0:05:53 --> 0:05:55
 a few books per month.

156
0:05:55 --> 0:05:59
 I know that a person who familiar

157
0:05:59 --> 0:06:02
 with reading, they will read maybe

158
0:06:02 --> 0:06:06
 10 or 20 or even 30.

159
0:06:06 --> 0:06:10
 That means maybe many books per month.

160
0:06:10 --> 0:06:12
 But for me, just a few, but it's

161
0:06:12 --> 0:06:14
 larger than general people.

162
0:06:14 --> 0:06:17
 And also the podcast, I listen some

163
0:06:17 --> 0:06:20
 of podcast about such as medical

164
0:06:20 --> 0:06:25
 or some stress training or single cavity.

165
0:06:25 --> 0:06:28
 And how the cavity maybe or yeah,

166
0:06:28 --> 0:06:31
 or something that some other topics

167
0:06:31 --> 0:06:34
 in also a video, watch a lot of YouTube

168
0:06:34 --> 0:06:37
 video such as a video playing games

169
0:06:37 --> 0:06:39
 or can decide or yeah, anything that AI

170
0:06:39 --> 0:06:41
 or anything else.

171
0:06:41 --> 0:06:44
 So it's for me, it's more easy to generate

172
0:06:44 --> 0:06:47
 a topic from my weekly life.

173
0:06:48 --> 0:06:50
 It's the same as a line with the previous

174
0:06:50 --> 0:06:51
 topic.

175
0:06:51 --> 0:06:54
 It's about that atomic habit that I need

176
0:06:54 --> 0:06:59
 to well, I need to add one more

177
0:06:59 --> 0:07:02
 or have it from my almost my daily

178
0:07:02 --> 0:07:06
 or weekly life and my origin weekly

179
0:07:06 --> 0:07:07
 daily life.

180
0:07:07 --> 0:07:09
 It's listening a podcast or watching

181
0:07:09 --> 0:07:12
 a YouTube videos in reading books.

182
0:07:12 --> 0:07:16
 So for me, it's taking the topics

183
0:07:16 --> 0:07:16
 from this.

184
0:07:16 --> 0:07:18
 It's more easy for me.

185
0:07:18 --> 0:07:23
 And also we have the AI finally in the

186
0:07:24 --> 0:07:24
 maybe the

187
0:07:24 --> 0:07:27
 last year that the GPT, Gemini,

188
0:07:27 --> 0:07:30
 cloud, any AI cannot do this that I

189
0:07:30 --> 0:07:33
 speaking a Chinese podcast, for example,

190
0:07:33 --> 0:07:36
 is 30 minutes and convert into English.

191
0:07:36 --> 0:07:40
 This is very hard for origin last year,

192
0:07:40 --> 0:07:43
 but this year we are more easy that I

193
0:07:43 --> 0:07:45
 can write a Chinese version and convert

194
0:07:45 --> 0:07:46
 into English.

195
0:07:47 --> 0:07:49
 And I'm not always following the subtitles

196
0:07:49 --> 0:07:52
 for the English version because I will

197
0:07:52 --> 0:07:54
 adding some written, written speaking,

198
0:07:54 --> 0:07:56
 like today's topic.

199
0:07:56 --> 0:07:58
 The subtitle is different from the Chinese

200
0:07:58 --> 0:07:59
 version.

201
0:07:59 --> 0:08:02
 Just for example, it's like a random choosing.

202
0:08:02 --> 0:08:08
 And for more, as we say that I will convert

203
0:08:08 --> 0:08:12
 into Japanese version also, but Japanese language,

204
0:08:12 --> 0:08:13
 I'm not familiar with that.

205
0:08:13 --> 0:08:16
 So maybe the Japanese part, I will more align

206
0:08:16 --> 0:08:20
 with the subtitles that generate convert from Chinese

207
0:08:20 --> 0:08:23
 and the English version cover into a Japanese part.

208
0:08:23 --> 0:08:24
 Okay.

209
0:08:24 --> 0:08:28
 Then next topic, we will really go into our

210
0:08:28 --> 0:08:30
 today's the real topic.

211
0:08:30 --> 0:08:35
 It's about MBTI, that it's a kind of social bias.

212
0:08:35 --> 0:08:36
 Okay.

213
0:08:36 --> 0:08:39
 So let's back to the deeper question here.

214
0:08:39 --> 0:08:42
 Society is full of personality discrimination.

215
0:08:43 --> 0:08:48
 So actually I hate discrimination, but especially

216
0:08:48 --> 0:08:52
 in Taiwan, people in current period, we are talking

217
0:08:52 --> 0:08:53
 about MBTI.

218
0:08:54 --> 0:08:54
 And try to use the MBTI.

219
0:08:54 --> 0:08:59
 To classify people and discriminate personality.

220
0:09:00 --> 0:09:04
 And not only this, in our modern society, in the medical

221
0:09:04 --> 0:09:09
 define that we also have a huge discriminate on different

222
0:09:09 --> 0:09:09
 people.

223
0:09:10 --> 0:09:13
 For example, when you are in a school, if you are a student

224
0:09:13 --> 0:09:17
 that you can stick into school's schedule, such as planning

225
0:09:17 --> 0:09:23
 that 45 minutes lesson, you will regard as restless and

226
0:09:23 --> 0:09:24
 impatient.

227
0:09:24 --> 0:09:27
 But everyone's cycle is not different.

228
0:09:27 --> 0:09:32
 For example, if a person hits, how to say that, concentration

229
0:09:32 --> 0:09:36
 or spend, it's a 90 minute a cycle.

230
0:09:37 --> 0:09:42
 So if a school have a 50 minute in the class and 10 minute

231
0:09:42 --> 0:09:47
 break, that means you cut off the two thirds of someone's

232
0:09:48 --> 0:09:54
 concentration that the next lesson, next class, he only have

233
0:09:54 --> 0:09:57
 30 minutes for the concentration.

234
0:09:58 --> 0:10:03
 But if the class is a 50 minute, we will think that this one is

235
0:10:03 --> 0:10:05
 a dissat, this checked.

236
0:10:05 --> 0:10:10
 So this is also kind of discrimination just because the system

237
0:10:10 --> 0:10:14
 is different from the personal cycle.

238
0:10:15 --> 0:10:18
 And for more structure of the modern school.

239
0:10:18 --> 0:10:23
 Yeah, frankly, if you look at the history that we will say that school are

240
0:10:23 --> 0:10:29
 like prisons and we will let jail a person in prison.

241
0:10:30 --> 0:10:34
 And so when you are in school, we feel like we are in jail.

242
0:10:34 --> 0:10:37
 That's because we need to systemize everything.

243
0:10:37 --> 0:10:44
 But actually, if you really go to such as historically, the prison

244
0:10:44 --> 0:10:48
 were designed based on the school that the jail is learning from the school

245
0:10:48 --> 0:10:52
 design, that's the school are the prototype of prison.

246
0:10:52 --> 0:10:53
 So this is a very important.

247
0:10:53 --> 0:10:53
 Yeah.

248
0:10:53 --> 0:10:53
 Yeah.

249
0:10:53 --> 0:10:54
 Very crazy.

250
0:10:55 --> 0:10:56
 Okay.

251
0:10:56 --> 0:11:02
 So, uh, this, uh, prison system, everyone it's, uh, institutionalized

252
0:11:02 --> 0:11:08
 and the result of institutionalization is that society wants to, uh, enslave

253
0:11:08 --> 0:11:14
 the lower classes people because the world is divided into two layers.

254
0:11:14 --> 0:11:19
 One is the slave layers in analysis, slave owners in that kind of situation.

255
0:11:19 --> 0:11:20
 Oh yes.

256
0:11:20 --> 0:11:21
 It's slave and master.

257
0:11:22 --> 0:11:23
 And people won't want to.

258
0:11:23 --> 0:11:38
 So, uh, it's, uh, that's why I say that it's a discrimination that the people, it's, uh, not the most of the system, or we will use the labeling a person in discriminate.

259
0:11:38 --> 0:11:39
 Okay.

260
0:11:39 --> 0:11:47
 So, uh, let's back to our MBTI case that, uh, in personally, uh, I don't think it's, it's a truly complete concept.

261
0:11:47 --> 0:11:53
 Uh, that means it's lacking and, uh, it's very, it's actually, it's, uh.

262
0:11:53 --> 0:11:59
 It's ambiguous and a fake, and it's a bad design concept.

263
0:12:00 --> 0:12:07
 But, uh, just, we can talking about that some concept that we can just, uh, regard it as a reference.

264
0:12:07 --> 0:12:09
 Don't check it.

265
0:12:09 --> 0:12:10
 Uh, don't treat it as too serious.

266
0:12:10 --> 0:12:12
 Just a reference.

267
0:12:12 --> 0:12:19
 Uh, don't make it a real, because it's people personality will more like spectrum, not a binary.

268
0:12:19 --> 0:12:19
 Yeah.

269
0:12:20 --> 0:12:20
 Okay.

270
0:12:21 --> 0:12:22
 Uh, going back to MBTI.

271
0:12:22 --> 0:12:23
 I think most people.

272
0:12:23 --> 0:12:25
 Uh, don't truly understand the core.

273
0:12:25 --> 0:12:27
 It's about the four dimensions.

274
0:12:27 --> 0:12:31
 Uh, so, uh, they will have a wrong classification of the people.

275
0:12:31 --> 0:12:34
 So, uh, we will start from, uh, one to one for each to each.

276
0:12:35 --> 0:12:39
 And for the MBTI, actually, uh, it will have a four dimension.

277
0:12:39 --> 0:12:42
 The first dimension is the IE dimension.

278
0:12:42 --> 0:12:44
 The second dimension is the NS.

279
0:12:44 --> 0:12:46
 The third is a TF.

280
0:12:46 --> 0:12:48
 The fourth is a JP.

281
0:12:48 --> 0:12:51
 And we were talking about the, uh, each dimension.

282
0:12:52 --> 0:12:53
 So, uh, the first dimension.

283
0:12:53 --> 0:12:55
 It's about I and E.

284
0:12:55 --> 0:12:56
 I is introversal.

285
0:12:56 --> 0:12:58
 And E is extroversal.

286
0:12:59 --> 0:13:09
 And there's, well, some, uh, misunderstanding that, uh, people, uh, will have a wrong concept on who is I type or who is E type.

287
0:13:09 --> 0:13:17
 Uh, because the real, uh, it's about that energy, uh, it's about that, uh, how you feel the energy preference.

288
0:13:17 --> 0:13:22
 Uh, for example, if you feel happy that you are in a grouping of people.

289
0:13:22 --> 0:13:22
 Uh.

290
0:13:23 --> 0:13:24
 You are E type.

291
0:13:24 --> 0:13:28
 Even you don't have the ability to social.

292
0:13:28 --> 0:13:32
 That you feel shy and you feel hard talking with people.

293
0:13:32 --> 0:13:39
 But if you feel, uh, happy to, uh, in a group, then you are E type person.

294
0:13:39 --> 0:13:50
 And in other side, that if you are a person that, uh, even you are very, uh, socializing, uh, you have a good ability to do a socialization.

295
0:13:50 --> 0:13:53
 And you, uh, have an ability to have many.

296
0:13:53 --> 0:13:53
 Friends.

297
0:13:54 --> 0:13:56
 But you don't feel happy that in group.

298
0:13:56 --> 0:14:00
 You feel more, uh, energy that when you are reading alone or do something alone.

299
0:14:01 --> 0:14:01
 You are the I person.

300
0:14:02 --> 0:14:04
 So, it's not about the ability.

301
0:14:04 --> 0:14:07
 It's about that, uh, what you want in your really mind.

302
0:14:08 --> 0:14:08
 Okay.

303
0:14:08 --> 0:14:13
 Uh, for example, the, uh, most important, uh, person to mention is, uh, Boqi Jiang.

304
0:14:14 --> 0:14:15
 Uh, from the Boqi the Rock.

305
0:14:16 --> 0:14:17
 Boqi, uh, she is the E person.

306
0:14:18 --> 0:14:21
 That, uh, she don't have the social ability.

307
0:14:21 --> 0:14:23
 But she is actually like.

308
0:14:23 --> 0:14:24
 To going with the everyone.

309
0:14:25 --> 0:14:28
 And she like to, uh, play with the, their friends.

310
0:14:28 --> 0:14:29
 And they want to go out.

311
0:14:30 --> 0:14:35
 And another example is that the Michael, the Tomori, Tomori-san.

312
0:14:35 --> 0:14:36
 Or Tomorin.

313
0:14:37 --> 0:14:40
 Uh, she is a really happy friend, uh, being in the band.

314
0:14:41 --> 0:14:44
 Band and, uh, she, uh, watching the people is chatting.

315
0:14:44 --> 0:14:45
 She is happy.

316
0:14:45 --> 0:14:47
 Uh, although she didn't talk much.

317
0:14:48 --> 0:14:48
 Yeah.

318
0:14:48 --> 0:14:51
 So the I is, uh, who likes being alone.

319
0:14:51 --> 0:14:52
 And, uh.

320
0:14:52 --> 0:14:55
 Uh, for example, it's like the Boqi the Rock.

321
0:14:55 --> 0:14:57
 Um, Boqi the Rock.

322
0:14:57 --> 0:15:00
 Uh, Leon, the, she, the bassist.

323
0:15:00 --> 0:15:04
 Uh, she is like to, uh, just, uh, walking alone.

324
0:15:04 --> 0:15:04
 Yeah.

325
0:15:05 --> 0:15:05
 Okay.

326
0:15:05 --> 0:15:07
 Uh, next, uh, Dimension.

327
0:15:07 --> 0:15:10
 It's about the, uh, N type and S type.

328
0:15:11 --> 0:15:18
 And I think you just, you don't need to, uh, think too much about the, uh, terms and about the words.

329
0:15:18 --> 0:15:21
 We just, uh, spill into two type, two class.

330
0:15:21 --> 0:15:22
 And one class.

331
0:15:22 --> 0:15:25
 It's that, uh, people will focus on fine grain, uh, topics.

332
0:15:26 --> 0:15:32
 And another people, uh, another type is that, uh, people will feeling more coarse grain.

333
0:15:33 --> 0:15:49
 That, uh, you will have, uh, yeah, we can use the discrimination about that, uh, to thinking that the, uh, N people that he will, uh, watch, uh, in, uh, more coarse grain, uh, in more strategy level.

334
0:15:50 --> 0:15:52
 And, uh, usually.

335
0:15:52 --> 0:15:57
 The N people will regard us, uh, he's not, uh, patient about details.

336
0:15:58 --> 0:16:02
 So this is kind of, uh, discrimination also.

337
0:16:02 --> 0:16:03
 Yeah.

338
0:16:03 --> 0:16:18
 For example, if you are practicing a musical instrument, uh, do you like to process or single note, uh, each sound to very detail, or you just want to, uh, play entire song and feel that, okay, I almost read on that.

339
0:16:19 --> 0:16:22
 If you are more prefer to fix, uh, every detail.

340
0:16:22 --> 0:16:30
 That means you are the, uh, S type that, um, it's, uh, you want to deal with the fine grain level.

341
0:16:30 --> 0:16:35
 And conversely, the N type of that, uh, we just care about the entire feeling.

342
0:16:36 --> 0:16:42
 And the problem is that it's hard, uh, to, um, process in the detail.

343
0:16:43 --> 0:16:51
 And we can say that, uh, if, uh, it just, uh, good enough or yeah, it's, or if you are talking about that, uh, that's enough.

344
0:16:51 --> 0:16:52
 And.

345
0:16:52 --> 0:16:53
 Oh, close enough.

346
0:16:53 --> 0:16:53
 Yeah.

347
0:16:53 --> 0:17:05
 So if you are talking about that close enough, that usually that means you are the, uh, you are the N type that you focus on, focus on the major part.

348
0:17:05 --> 0:17:05
 Yeah.

349
0:17:06 --> 0:17:06
 Okay.

350
0:17:07 --> 0:17:17
 And for the, uh, different, uh, the key different than just, uh, you've more focused on fine grain or more focused on, uh, close grain.

351
0:17:17 --> 0:17:18
 Yeah.

352
0:17:19 --> 0:17:22
 And another dimension.

353
0:17:22 --> 0:17:22
 Yeah.

354
0:17:22 --> 0:17:31
 We will, uh, talking about that is the T and F and the T and F also, uh, don't care about the origin, original return.

355
0:17:31 --> 0:17:48
 We just, uh, thinking about the, uh, energy, uh, concept that, uh, which one you feel more better that, uh, you feel more better, uh, focusing on logical power or, uh, you feel more about the social component power than the human feeling.

356
0:17:49 --> 0:17:52
 That, uh, if you are more focused on logical power.

357
0:17:52 --> 0:17:52
 Uh, you feel more about the social part.

358
0:17:52 --> 0:18:04
 You are the T or person, uh, for example, like the, uh, bridge, uh, Ray Dario, uh, that, uh, it's the bridge water associate.

359
0:18:05 --> 0:18:22
 He have, uh, wrote a book principle that he just, uh, regard everything, uh, in logically and for even, uh, his, uh, to logically that people think he's a evil devil that, uh, why, why you don't so care about.

360
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

361
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

362
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

363
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

364
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

365
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

366
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

367
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

368
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

369
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

370
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Okay.

371
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Thank you.

372
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Thank you.

373
0:18:22 --> 0:18:22
 Thank you.

374
0:18:23 --> 0:18:23
 Thank you.

375
0:18:23 --> 0:18:30
 And the same thing that such as the air mask, uh, he's focusing on, uh, event.

376
0:18:31 --> 0:18:33
 He just focusing on what you want to do.

377
0:18:33 --> 0:18:34
 So you don't care about that people.

378
0:18:34 --> 0:18:45
 Uh, he just thinking that all crew, I just, uh, or items of, uh, just a machine to generate, uh, what you want, for example, the cars.

379
0:18:45 --> 0:18:45
 Yeah.

380
0:18:46 --> 0:18:52
 And for the F part that, uh, it's a person that, uh, it's very.

381
0:18:52 --> 0:19:01
 care about human. For example, Teresa, that she's very complain about the poor,

382
0:19:01 --> 0:19:11
 that she must be very F-type. So of course, that will be discriminate that if

383
0:19:11 --> 0:19:17
 a person is very T-type, focusing on logic. Well, people will think you

384
0:19:17 --> 0:19:24
 are a nerd. It's not comparing to anyone. You don't have the patience. And on the

385
0:19:24 --> 0:19:30
 other side, people who will be F-type, it will be discriminated that you are not

386
0:19:30 --> 0:19:35
 logically, why you don't talking about the sense. You are talking is not about

387
0:19:35 --> 0:19:41
 sense. It's not make sense. Yeah. So it's discrimination of two dimension. And

388
0:19:41 --> 0:19:46
 they have the fourth dimension. It's about J and P case.

389
0:19:46 --> 0:19:47
 That is,

390
0:19:47 --> 0:19:55
 for J-type. Again, don't talk about the terms which are thinking about that. You

391
0:19:55 --> 0:20:02
 are doing things in generally in common and in regular daily routine, and you

392
0:20:02 --> 0:20:12
 prefer to bling and managing things into order, or you more prefer that it's

393
0:20:12 --> 0:20:17
 random and you accept maybe it's generating in

394
0:20:17 --> 0:20:17
 random and you accept maybe it's generating in

395
0:20:17 --> 0:20:17
 random and you accept maybe it's generating in

396
0:20:17 --> 0:20:23
 probability and everything is not the same and if you are doing the same thing

397
0:20:23 --> 0:20:27
 you will be crazy or you will be frustrated if things will keep again

398
0:20:27 --> 0:20:36
 there you mean P so the J type it's like things to be similar arranged and maybe

399
0:20:36 --> 0:20:43
 it's a predictable and for the P person P type they are more prefer it's

400
0:20:43 --> 0:20:52
 unpredictable and different it's diverse and usually we will laughing that a

401
0:20:52 --> 0:21:01
 person learn things for not long this is a kind of P person okay so we can

402
0:21:01 --> 0:21:10
 take music as example if you are prefer to practicing for song for more

403
0:21:10 --> 0:21:12
 longer and because they are the same song and

404
0:21:12 --> 0:21:13
 you prefer to practice for longer and because they are the same song and you

405
0:21:13 --> 0:21:19
 practicing it you feel very happy you feel some of the you feel your energy

406
0:21:19 --> 0:21:26
 for example it's classical music you may more close to J type in otherwise when

407
0:21:26 --> 0:21:31
 you are practicing jazz music that they usually need to be random they need to

408
0:21:31 --> 0:21:39
 be different and you there be every such as amazing or surprising yeah it's a

409
0:21:39 --> 0:21:42
 part that you will more like the P person

410
0:21:42 --> 0:21:43
 but

411
0:21:43 --> 0:21:43
 you will be more like the P person but you will be more like the P person but

412
0:21:43 --> 0:21:52
 actually of course you can you can play that just a random classical music

413
0:21:52 --> 0:22:01
 without any practicing it's like the we will call that how to say that in music

414
0:22:01 --> 0:22:09
 that we will okay in improvisation improvisation that you can also you can

415
0:22:09 --> 0:22:13
 play improvisation of the in jazz music

416
0:22:13 --> 0:22:20
 play it in classical music and otherwise you can design very

417
0:22:20 --> 0:22:29
 structure arrangement a song of jazz music so again you can play a classical

418
0:22:29 --> 0:22:36
 music but as a improvisation part that it's a random classical music and also

419
0:22:36 --> 0:22:43
 you can decide a jazz style music with very arranged

420
0:22:43 --> 0:22:50
 It's a you can practicing the same song every day. Yeah, so it's not about jazz or classical

421
0:22:50 --> 0:22:58
 It's about that you more prefer doing daily or you more daily the same or you more prefer the different

422
0:22:58 --> 0:23:00
 It's more random. Yeah

423
0:23:00 --> 0:23:02
 Okay

424
0:23:02 --> 0:23:05
 So I know that there will some

425
0:23:06 --> 0:23:09
 discrimination always be the other side and

426
0:23:09 --> 0:23:11
 And they will have I need to

427
0:23:12 --> 0:23:18
 Emphasize that there are not always to be binary people will be spectrum

428
0:23:18 --> 0:23:22
 So for example, maybe you will be a 70%

429
0:23:22 --> 0:23:28
 P style and maybe 30% J style or maybe on 90%

430
0:23:29 --> 0:23:32
 F style 10% T style. So

431
0:23:33 --> 0:23:36
 Don't just class people into binary part

432
0:23:36 --> 0:23:39
 I will recommend that more

433
0:23:39 --> 0:23:41
 spectrum part

434
0:23:41 --> 0:23:48
 And we will see that some people will say the Elon Musk Tesla found Tesla CEO

435
0:23:49 --> 0:23:56
 It's a INTJ. I will say that this is a bullshit. You can see that Elon Musk. It's like to

436
0:23:57 --> 0:23:59
 It's not to

437
0:23:59 --> 0:24:01
 to ask him about that

438
0:24:02 --> 0:24:08
 talking on people on tweet and now it's X and it's he also want to

439
0:24:09 --> 0:24:11
 have a date with many girls and he have

440
0:24:12 --> 0:24:17
 diverse diverse many times that he must be the E type and

441
0:24:17 --> 0:24:22
 You will see that he always want to break his rules for example

442
0:24:23 --> 0:24:27
 He will go some plane but next maybe month or week

443
0:24:27 --> 0:24:35
 He will just want to go another side and even they need to lay a crew to tell him that this plan cannot change

444
0:24:35 --> 0:24:38
 and he has too many things such that
