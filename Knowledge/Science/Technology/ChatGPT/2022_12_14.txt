That will be boring because the game don't have key TA
Having a wide range of gameplay elements and components can make a game more interesting and engaging, but it is not the only factor that determines whether a game is fun or boring. The key to creating a fun and engaging game is to find the right balance between complexity and simplicity, challenge and reward, and variety and repetition. A game with a good balance of these factors will be able to provide a satisfying and enjoyable experience for players, regardless of whether it includes specific elements or components such as those mentioned in the previous answer.


TA is target audience
Yes, that is correct. Target audience, or TA, refers to the specific group of people that a product, service, or piece of content is intended to appeal to or target. In the context of video games, the target audience is the group of players that the game is designed for, based on factors such as age, gender, interests, and gaming experience. Understanding the target audience is important for game designers, because it helps them to create games that will appeal to the specific group of players they are targeting, and to market the game effectively to that group.

Having a wide range of gameplay elements or features does not necessarily mean that a game does not have a good target audience setting. In fact, a game with a wide range of features can be appealing to a broad audience, depending on how those features are designed and implemented. The key to creating a game with a good target audience setting is to understand the specific group of players that the game is intended for, and to design the game in a way that will appeal to those players. This might involve incorporating features and gameplay elements that are specifically tailored to the interests and preferences of the target audience, as well as marketing the game in a way that will reach and engage that audience.

It is not possible to say with certainty why the game was not successful, but some possible reasons could include:

Lack of focus: Anthem was designed as a "live service" game, meaning that it was intended to be constantly updated and expanded over time. However, this approach may have resulted in the game lacking a clear focus or direction, which made it difficult for players to know what to expect from the game.
Poor execution: Despite its many features, Anthem was criticized for being buggy and poorly optimized, which made it difficult for players to enjoy the game. In addition, the game's story and characters were not well received by many players, which further detracted from the overall experience.
Lack of support: Anthem was released in 2019, but it did not receive much support from BioWare or Electronic Arts in the months and years following its release. This lack of support may have made players feel like the game was abandoned, which reduced their motivation to continue playing it.
Overall, the failure of Anthem may have been due to a combination of factors, including a lack of focus, poor execution, and lack of support from the developers.
