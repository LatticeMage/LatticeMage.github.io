Learned helplessness is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual becomes unable to escape or avoid a negative situation because they have come to believe that their actions have no effect on the outcome. This can occur when an individual is repeatedly subjected to an aversive or negative stimulus that they are unable to escape or avoid, even when the opportunity to do so is later presented.  Gambling fallacies are beliefs or assumptions about the outcome of a game of chance that are not based on factual evidence or sound reasoning. These fallacies can lead to poor decision-making and irrational behavior, and can result in financial losses.  Relying too heavily on historical data and experience can also lead to overfitting, as the world and the situations we face are constantly changing. This can cause us to make decisions that are not well-suited to the current context, and can lead to negative consequences.  In all of these cases, the potential drawbacks of overfitting arise when we become too closely tied to a particular perspective, approach, or set of data, and lose our ability to adapt to new situations or incorporate new information. This can prevent us from taking action to improve our situation or make informed and rational decisions.  To avoid the negative consequences of overfitting, it is important to recognize the limitations of any given perspective or approach, and to be open to new ideas and ways of thinking. By maintaining a flexible and adaptable mindset, we can make more informed and rational decisions, and avoid the pitfalls of learned helplessness, gambling fallacies, and other negative consequences of overfitting.  --- tags:   - [[Philosophy]]   - [[History]]   - [[Learned Helplessness]]    ---
