The text draws parallels between the development of painting and music, focusing on their core concepts:

1.  In painting, the key concepts are Perspective, Composition, and Color:
    
    *   Perspective is related to three-dimensional geometry.
    *   Composition involves the arrangement of points, lines, and planes, emphasizing dynamics.
    *   Color is about the study of colors, a field that has been deeply explored in modern painting styles.
2.  The development of these elements in painting occurred in a specific order: Perspective was fully developed first, while Color theory is a more recent and deeply explored aspect.
    
3.  In music, these concepts have analogs:
    
    *   Classical music is likened to Perspective in painting, requiring precise calculations and having a perfect theoretical structure (e.g., pieces that can be played backwards).
    *   Jazz and Blues focus on melody flow and rhythm, similar to the dynamic aspect of Composition in painting.
    *   Chord theory in music, which has been deeply developed only recently, is highlighted by mentioning Jacob Collier, known for his expertise in music theory.

This comparison highlights the evolution and depth of theory in both art forms, showing how each medium has its own complex set of rules and development history.
