It's become increasingly clear to me how crucial speed is in entrepreneurship. My ability to use AI for coding and understanding investing has significantly accelerated my work in algorithmic trading. This pace is exhilarating, yet it's also a reminder of the areas where I need to grow.

On the other hand, my progress in game design feels slower. My drawing skills aren't keeping up with the pace I desire. This is a stark reminder that learning and skill development are ongoing journeys. It echoes the logic of the TC=FC+VC theory, where the focus should be on Fixed Costs â€“ investing time and effort in research and building a solid foundation, or a 'moat', around my projects.

Reflecting on the broader picture of investing and startups, I realize that success often hinges on one's ability to gather and interpret information more effectively than others. Some are naturally adept at extracting more insights from the same information everyone else has.

Networking, too, plays a pivotal role. It's not just about who you know; it's about the quality of interactions and the exchange of ideas. Casual meetings and discussions, like those I've had with industry experts, can unexpectedly trigger valuable insights and ideas.

So, as I navigate my path, I'm learning to balance the need for rapid progress with the importance of continuous learning and building meaningful connections. It's a challenging yet exciting journey.
