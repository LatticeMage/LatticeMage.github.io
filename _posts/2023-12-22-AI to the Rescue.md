In the past, it was normal to graduate with a Ph.D. in four years, but now it often takes seven or eight years to complete one's studies. Humanity has entered a period of slow progress. This is evident in academia, where Ph.D. students spend years just studying the work of their predecessors. The surge in the number of research papers makes it challenging to produce cutting-edge theories at a rapid pace, as we have seen in fewer generations like Einstein's.

Writing new papers has become more challenging too. Many previously easy experiments have already been conducted, and current experiments often require extensive design. This has slowed down the pace of research. In many fields, progress now requires collaboration among top researchers from multiple domains.

Recently, AI has begun to emerge as a ray of hope in addressing these challenges. Although it hasn't completely solved these issues yet, AI is making it easier to extract and organize relevant contexts from the vast sea of papers and assist in various experimental predictions. In the near future, anyone will be able to use AI for these purposes. Human research is entering a new era of logic, thanks to AI's emergence to address the cultural crisis of humanity.

This trend extends beyond academia to the internet at large. There is an overwhelming amount of information online, including AI-generated content, leading to an exponential increase in internet data. Finding complete context and accuracy in this vast sea of information is becoming increasingly difficult. In the future, people will likely rely on AI to consume news or internet data, navigating through this complex and abundant information landscape.
