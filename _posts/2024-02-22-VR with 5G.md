曾博恩 mentioned that his live stand-up show has been recorded in a 360 VR version with quite good effects (at that time, it was still on Oculus 2). The fidelity is quite high, even able to reproduce the ambiance of different seating positions - sitting in different spots gives you a distinct sense of place.

This would be particularly well-suited for concerts, where your view and experience vary significantly based on your location.

I think 5G exists for the sake of streaming. If streaming can be achieved, then the weight of VR devices could be significantly reduced (only needing to connect to the cloud with mobile-level hardware).

Thinking from this perspective, Microsoft is very likely to venture into the AR segment as they aim to push for a subscription model.
