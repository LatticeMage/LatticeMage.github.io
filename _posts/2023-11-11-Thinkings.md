### About Futher tech
* Multi-view render such as photon mapping may use in MMOVR game
* GPTs just like iphone app

  * need to find other way such as airbnb, uber this different dimension
* AIGC will make it's harder for small creators to rise because the big ones easily get bigger. 
  * Previously, music was refreshed with new voices, but now AI can sing with any voice. Once a singer licenses their voice to AI, new singers lose the chance to replace them.
  * The same goes for actors. With stars like Tom Cruise licensing their likeness to AI, new actors can't wait for their turn anymore.

### About Philosophy

* due to AICG and art ai, people who drawing is really for hobby not for money anymore.

### future music AI
The text describes DALL-E 3 as a system where users communicate with GPT-4 to describe the image they want, instead of directly providing prompts to DALL-E. This might be inconvenient for some, especially those used to working with Midjourney or Stable Diffusion where they can specify certain objects in the image. However, the text highlights the importance of this approach in music AI, where a user can describe a type of music to GPT, which then instructs a music AI to create it. This is beneficial as most people cannot describe music technically but can reference a similar song, allowing AI to use terms like "Dorian scale" or "walking bass" to create music.

### build up new concepts
The text reflects on the challenges of concept formation, emphasizing that learning and acquiring concepts in a single field can be difficult. However, it points out that individuals who have studied in multiple disciplines may find it easier to transfer and apply concepts from one field to another. This cross-disciplinary approach can facilitate a deeper and more versatile understanding, enabling the application of knowledge and ideas from one area of study to enrich another.
